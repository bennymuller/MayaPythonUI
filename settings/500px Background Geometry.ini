;MeshLODs are created by removing edges and vertices from the original mesh, while preserving critical features and all relevant original vertex data. Mesh LODs are often used for creating a set of AutoLODs for each prop and character in a game, in order to reduce triangle count. ProxyLODs are made by generating one new mesh (proxy mesh) and one new set of textures (proxy maps). The new mesh and texture resemble a copy of the base model, which looks similar to the base model at the defined LOD switch onscreen size. Proxy LODs are often used to replace groups of static objects with many materials and meshes, at a distance in a game scene. Switching to a Proxy LOD thus significantly reduces both the number of draw calls and triangle counts, specially in large outdoor scenes. Using Proxy LODs sometimes be referred to as hierarchical LODs or LOD parents since they replace a group of objects with one proxy LOD. AggregateLODs are made by aggregating all geometry and materials into a single asset.
